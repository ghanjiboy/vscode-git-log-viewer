# Git Log Viewer

A TortoiseGit-inspired git log viewer for VS Code. Right-click any file or folder in the Explorer to view its git history in an interactive, multi-panel tab.

## Features

### Git Log Dialog
Right-click a file or folder in the VS Code Explorer and select **Show Git Log** to open a three-panel log viewer:

- **Commit list** — sortable columns (SHA, Message, Author, Date) with infinite scroll pagination
- **Commit details** — full SHA, author, date, and commit message body
- **Changed files** — files modified in the selected commit with status, lines added/removed

### Compare Revisions
Ctrl+click two commits in the log view, then right-click and select **Compare Selected Revisions** to see all files changed between those commits. Each commit's details are shown side-by-side at the top for context.

When viewing a single file's log, comparing two revisions opens a direct diff of that file between the two commits.

### File History
Right-click any file in the changed files list and select **Show File Log** to open a new log tab scoped to just that file.

### Diff Viewer
Double-click any file in the changed files list to compare it against its previous revision using VS Code's built-in diff editor. Works in both the log view and the compare revisions view.

### Blame View
Right-click a file in the changed files list and select **Blame** to open an interactive blame view:

- **Left panel** — revision gutter showing SHA, author, and relative date, color-coded by commit
- **Right panel** — source code with line numbers, scroll-synced with the gutter
- **Commit info panel** — hover over any line to see full commit details; click to lock the selection

### Theme Support
All views automatically adapt to your VS Code theme (dark, light, or high contrast) using native CSS variables.

1. Open a git repository in VS Code
2. In the Explorer sidebar, right-click any file or folder
